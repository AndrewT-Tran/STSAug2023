Book Club
=========

For this assignment, you'll be putting together all of the cumulative skills you have developed building full-stack applications. We recommend simply extending the functionality of your existing Login & Registration project, by adding a new model, Book. You'll also be implementing a one-to-many relationship between Books and Users. That is, users can post (create) many books, but books may only have one user who posted it.

### Learning Objectives:

*   Add users to an application with Create and Read capabilities
*   Implement a one-to-many relationship between User and another model
*   Identify and implement routes for requests based on a wireframe
*   Manage a user session (login status) by storing and reading their ID in session
*   Apply cumulative skills to build and de-bug a full-stack application
